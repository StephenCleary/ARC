Simple dynamic language with prototypal inheritance.
- "base" is just a convention, not a keyword.
TODO: Determine host context, required "standard library" objects, etc.
- Is there some way of isolating extensions?
- Types:
  - Null. Only one value; actually a unit type.
  - Object. Associative array.
  - String. UTF16. Immutable?
  - Number. Decimal/decimal64. Immutable?
  - Function. Immutable?
- Stdlib types: Array, Regex, Math?
- Operators:
  - defined(expr) - returns true if expression is defined.
  - typeof(expr) - do we need this?
  - Numeric: +, -, *, /, %, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=
    - Integer division? Or should all rounding be explicit?
  - String: &
    - Do we need anything else?
- Functions: lexically-scoped closures.
- Are strings and functions objects? What about Number or Null?
- Strongly order all object values?
  null < function (ordered by function text as a string) < number (numeric ordering) < string (UTF16 code point ordering) < object (can define own ordering; default is based on keys/values)
- null propagating operator on by default?

Rules actually in the language: ;)
- Implicit conversions never throw and always use the invariant culture.

Stdlib:
- Culture-based formatting/parsing.
- Hex, currency, and other special formatting/parsing.
