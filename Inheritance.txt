Objects inherit from objects.
To create a new "instance", need to create a new object.
Can we do this in a clean way with factory/constructor methods?

var Base = (width, height) =>
{
  width,
  height,
  area: (this.) => this.width * this.height,
};

var instance = Base(3, 5);
// "instance" does not have a "base" member; it's not deriving from anything; it's an instance of Base.

var Derived = (width, height) =>
{
  base = Base(width, height),
  quack: () => say("I'm a duck")
};

var derivedInstance = Derived(3, 5);
// "derivedInstance" does have a "base" member, an instance of Base.
// This is what Crockford calls "parasitic inheritance"; it creates its own instances all the way up. No way to modify Base after the fact.

Embracing Prototypal Inheritance:

var rectangle =
{
  create: (this., width, height) =>
  {
    return
    {
      base = this,
      width,
      height,
    };
  },
  area: (this.) =>
  {
    return this.width * this.height;
  },
};

var rect = rectangle.create(3, 5); // rect == { base: rectangle, width: 3, height: 5 }
var area = rect.area();

var square = { base: rectangle };
square.create = (this., side) => { return this.base.create.call(this, side, side); } // Overrides "this" for the base constructor.

Can we provide sufficient stdlib support for:
- Delegation (for simple methods and scalar default values)
- Concatenation (for state and aggregate default values) - "extend" in jQuery or _ - ones that are passed in later override previous values.
  extend(target, params concats[])
- Mixins/Blueprints (for methods, optionally with private state)
stampit(methods, state, enclose);
- StampIt can .compose() with other stammps.
-> Does the language need to support inheritance at all??? Yes; delegation requires it.
-> Support multiple inheritance?
-> Or a special "extend" method that deep-copies all state and also closure variables. Combines Concatenation with Blueprints.
  - But what if closure variables are specifically referencing *global, shared* state???
-> The core problem: in proto/mixin inheritance, you want local state but what happens if the proto/mixin gets new state?
  - Can we do "shadow state" or something crazy?
-> If we introduce the notion of "private" then Blueprints are no longer necessary.
- Have ".(thisArg, other, args)" syntax instead of "call"?
- JS allows you to add a property that does not participate in enumeration?
- Polymorphism: In JS, "this" always refers to the most-derived object, so when you "base.X()", within X(), "this" does not refer to "base".
  - If "x.init()" delegates to "y.init()", should "this" refer to x or y? Maybe have "this." and "self."? How would "self." be defined? The object containing the function reference.
- Self used a "traits object" which consisted of methods and acted as the prototype for the actual object that is then cloned to create an instance.
- Do "modules" provide a viable alternative to inheritance?
- "var x = new y;" shorthand for Object.Create? or: "var x = { base: y };" and reserve "new" for cloning semantics.
- Can we allow objects to override __getMember/__setMember? If so, they can support multiple inheritance.

Delegate minimization:
(args) => { } is ambiguous: a noop function (returning null) or a function that returns an empty object?
Do try to keep the "x," instead of "x: x,"
